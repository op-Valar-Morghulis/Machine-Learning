# Machine-Learning

Fall Semester Experiment, 2019
The majority of the experiments are implemented in Matlab code and a few of them are in python, only one of them(Decision Tree) provided both language implementations.
I wish my work could bring you some inspirations and I would be thankful if you truly love it and give this repository a star.
